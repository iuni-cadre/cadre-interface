## **CADRE Gateway Overview**

![Gatewate Architecture](figures/cadre_architecture.png)

The CADRE Gateway is a web-based interface that allows users to query large science of science data sets. A complex system of Amazon Web Services (AWS) services is used to allow the Gateway to function.

The entirety of the gateway is hosted on AWS and uses various services. We use a Virtual Private Cloud with two subnets to separate public facing code from the databases, AWS services, and system level code. The private subnet is only accessible through an SSH bastion or an Apache web server found in the public subnet.

The user interface uses an AWS service called Elastic Beanstalk that allows code to be run without having to manage a web server manually. The interface uses a frontend primarily written using Vue.js and a backend that uses Python to connect to databases and expose API endpoints.

Users log into the system using a third-party service called CILogon. CILogon is a federated login system that allows users to log in using their university account (or Gmail). Upon logging in, the user’s data (name, email, institution, etc.) is sent to the CADRE servers so that the Gateway can generate all required metadata, permissions, and folders in the system. We also create entries in AWS Cognito, to further handle permissions and login duties. Cognito is an AWS service that handles user pools and makes it easier to manage user permissions within the AWS ecosystem.

To reduce the cost of the VMs, we temporarily suspend these VMs unless a dataset is being actively queried, so the cost is dependent on usage. Adding more datasets, or version of datasets, would require another 5-node cluster for each dataset supported.

When a query is submitted from the Gateway interface, a message is added to a queue running on AWS’s Simple Queue Service (SQS). A “listener” EC2 VM watches this queue, and when it sees that a user has submitted a query, it will start the cluster and run the query against the chosen JanusGraph database. Once completed, the results will be saved to a user’s personal space on the AWS Elastic File System (EFS). Users can then use a Jupyter notebook to open these files and do postprocessing on the data.

Like the datasets’ EC2 VMs, a user’s Jupyter notebook is not always running to save on cost. We use another cluster of EC2 VMs managed by Kubernetes to create new Jupyter notebook servers on demand. When a user requests to open a notebook, Kubernetes will create a containerized Jupyter server and mount that user’s personal EFS space where they can access query results and personal scripts.

The Marketplace features use a similar Kubernetes/SQS system. To create a package that can automatically run tools and reproduce results, users need to archive datasets and register tools with the system. When a user archives a dataset (query results), the .csv result files will be zipped and stored on AWS’s Simple Storage Service (S3). When a package is run, this archived dataset will be downloaded to the running user’s EFS storage space so that a tool can be run against it.

Creating a tool is a little more complex. A user will create a python script in their Jupyter notebook. After choosing to create a tool, the user can choose one or more python files to include in the tool. A message will be sent to an SQS queue including the user and the files. A listener within the Kubernetes cluster will generate a Docker file and bundle the python scripts and docker file.

Creating a package is a matter of choosing an available tool and an available data archive. The information is saved to a database and made available to users through the marketplace. When a user runs a package, a message is again put on an SQS queue. A listener will watch for a message and download the tool and dataset to a user’s EFS space. A docker container is created and automatically run, using the tool scripts and the given archive. The resulting output is saved to the user’s EFS space and is viewable through the Jupyter notebook, just like query results.

### Notebooks
- For notebooks, we use jupyterhub
- Installation and other userful info can be found [here](https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/amazon/step-zero-aws.html)
- Details about configs and instructions found [here](https://github.com/iuni-cadre/cadre-notebooks)
- We use [jupyter REST API](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/rest.html) to generate tokens and create notebook servers for users
- Admin username is IUNITester, if you need an admin token, you need to navigate to the
admin panel and create an api token. We have created admin tokens and they are used
in cadre-interface middleware. If you revoke api tokens, you need to redeploy the Elastic
beanstalk instance with a new api key.
- `Config.yml` can be found in the jupyter driver home directory.
- To redeploy jupyterhub
    - `helm upgrade -f config.yaml jhub jupyterhub/jupyterhub --version=0.8.2`

### Kubernetes cluster
- Both production and dev vpcs, contains kubernetes cluster with 1 master, 4 nodes and
one driver node
- Production cluster configured to auto scale according to the load, dev is not yet
configured.
- To run all the kubernetes operations, you need to login to driver node. (using
`ssh_to_jupyter` from bastion)
- `kops` commands use to update the cluster, node configurations etc.
- [Run packages with Kubernetes](https://github.com/iuni-cadre/cadre-wiki/wiki/Run-packages-with-Kubernetes)

- Data pipeline and provenance for CADRE
    - Github [link](https://github.com/iuni-cadre/DataPipelineAndProvenanceForCADRE) to the official public repo for the data pipeline and provenance for CADRE

### Cadre Datasets
- Separate EC2 instances for MAG and WoS
- Each ec2 instance contains postgres DB and neo4j DB
- Each should have EFS mounted

### AWS operations and services

    instances
- SQS (Simple Queue Service)
    - Cadre-janus-queue.fifo
    - Cadre-job-queue.fifo
    - Cadre-package.fifo

    - Sudo supervisorctl to see status of cadre-start-jg-listener
    - Crontab -e to view the automation and path to script
        - Path to python environment: `/home/ubuntu/cloud-admin/venv/bin/activate`
        - Path to idle checker: `/home/ubuntu/cloud-admin/aws/idle_checker/idle_checker.py`
        - Path to (???): `/aws/ec2 januscluster start python script`

## Architecture Maintenance
Because of the large amount of data, we need to use some of the larger VMs available, which can cost upwards of $20,000 in total, per month. To bring this cost down to around $5,000 - $7,000 per month, we temporarily suspend these VMs unless a dataset is being actively queried, so the cost is dependent on usage. Adding more datasets, or version of datasets, would require another 5-node cluster for each dataset supported.
